# FVE STAVBY

March | 2025

I designed and developed a multi-language website for a solar panel installation service provider. The site is built with modern web technologies, optimized for performance and SEO, and features service pages for both residential and commercial customers. I implemented dynamic content using i18next for localization and ensured responsiveness across all devices.
